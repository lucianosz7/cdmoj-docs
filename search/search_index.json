Our main goal is to create a simple submission system where teachers can set contests, or exercise lists, to their students and follow how students are evolving in an Algorithm class. Also we use a simple system to detect software plagiarism. Besides the idea of creating a simple system for professors, we aim to create an API to deploy an decentralized infrastructure to judge problems online. The idea is to create trustworthy peers to judge problems, in order to avoid outages of some judge sites. Besides, anyone could set it own instance of CD-MOJ and could benefit of this model and also to contribute with a judging machine. We look forward some students to create and set this distributed model of judging problems. Code CD-MOJ is entirely written in Bash script, server and html side. It is easy to maintain and easy to create plugins. If you would like to contribute to our platform, please feel free to send bug reports and pull requests.
